        I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon\
        Oh, when you\'re looking at the sun\
        I\'m not a fool, I\'m not a fool, not a fool\
        No, you\'re not fooling anyone\
        Oh, but when you\'re gone\
        When you\'re gone, when you\'re gone\
        Oh baby, all the lights go out\
        Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong\
        I was wrong, I was wrong\
        Come back to me, baby, we can work this out\
        Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you\
        Just another chance so that I can show\
        That I wont let you down and run\
        No, I wont let you down and run\
        Cause I could be the one\
        I could be the one\
        I could be the one\
        I could be the one\
        I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue\
        Oh, when you see everything in red\
        There is nothing that I wouldnt do for you\
        Do for you, do for you\

        My mama dont like you and she likes everyone\
        And I never like to admit that I was wrong\
        And Ive been so caught up in my job\
        Didnt see whats going on\
        But now I know\
        Im better sleeping on my own\
        Cause if you like the way you look that much\
        Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself\
        And if you think that Im still holding on to something\

            Ill smile, I know what it takes to fool this town\
            Ill do it till the sun goes down and all through the night time\
            Ill tell you what you wanna hear\
            Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear\
            Its never the right time\
            I put my armor on, show you how strong I am\
            I put my armor on, Ill show you that I am\
            Im unstoppable, Im a Porsche with no brakes\
            Im invincible, I win every single game\
            Im so powerful, I dont need batteries to play\
            Im so confident, Im unstoppable today\
            Unstoppable today, unstoppable today\
            Unstoppable today, Im unstoppable today\

        Took you like a shot\
        Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening\
        Let a couple years water down how Im feeling about you\
        (Feeling about you)\
        And every time we talk\
        Every single word builds up to this moment\
        And I gotta convince myself I dont want it\
        Even though I do (even though I do)\
        You could break my heart in two\
        But when it heals, it beats for you\
        I know its forward, but its true\
        I wanna hold you when Im not supposed to\
        When im lying close to someone else\
        Youre stuck in my head and I cant get you out of it\
        If I could do it all again\
        I know Id go back to you\
        I know Id go back to you\
